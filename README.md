# create-a-website

A quick tutorial to help get under-priveledged primary and high school kids from zero to a live website in just a few hours!

The bootstrap docs are provided offline because many of the kids don't have decent access to internet at home. They are also encouraged to look through the docs themselves to enrich and personalise their own sites.
